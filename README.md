# Unexpected NaN Handling in Conditional Logic

This JavaScript code demonstrates an unusual behavior when handling `NaN` (Not a Number) in conditional statements. The `foo` function intends to provide different outputs based on the input value `x` but it fails to address the case where `x` is `NaN`. 

## Bug Description

The bug lies in how the function handles the `NaN` value. The conditional checks (`x === null`, `x < 0`) do not correctly identify `NaN`. As a result, the function returns `NaN` when `NaN` is passed as input.  This is unexpected because `NaN` should likely be handled explicitly.  For instance, it might be reasonable to return a specific error code, or to throw an exception.

## Solution

The solution involves adding an explicit check for `NaN` using the `isNaN()` function before the other conditional statements.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the code with a JavaScript interpreter (e.g., Node.js).
3. Observe that the function returns `NaN` when `NaN` is passed as the input.
